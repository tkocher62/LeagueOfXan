# League Of Xan
This is my first game. I created this game in the game engine [Unity](https://unity.com/) as a surprise birthday present for my girlfriend. The idea for the game was based around a prank that a few of my friends had played on me. It's meant to be a dungeon crawler game in which you fight through many stages to find and defeat the boss. This game was made over the source of about two months. It's designed to be a mobile game.

# Game Creation
The entire process of this game's creation was recorded and timelapsed.
Any sped up video clips are at 60x speed.

### Lure / Story
The story for this game was based on a prank pulled on me in real life. I wrote a script to simulate a similar event to the real one on the popular platform [Discord](https://discord.com), recorded it, and edited it into a small cutscene to indirectly explain the story of the game to the player.

### Game Design
There are a total of 5 playable characters and 6 enemies. The playable characters represent myself, my girlfriend, and three of our friends. Each character was designed to have attacks that represent their personality as well as attacks that are all vastly different from one another in order to have a wide variety of types of attacks. Consequently, the enemies were all made to require different types of attacks to beat. Some enemies are easier to defeat with specific types of attacks. This causes the player to need to use all 5 playable characters throughout the game in order to effectively beat the game.

### Level Design
The game contains a total of 8 levels, all of which were hand painted. I found a few 16x16 pixel tilesets online, which are collections of small tiles that can be used to paint a scene. I then split these sets into individual sprites and built the levels using those textures.

### Art
Most of the art in this game was handmade specifically for this game. This required creation of art and then implementation into the game through programming. For instance, the following videos show the creation and implementation of a laser beam.

### Boss Fight
The boss is a very unpredictable fight. He operates off a lot of random factors, moves quickly, and is the hardest part of the game.

### Statistics / Achievements
The game comes with statistics and achievements that can be used to compete against others in friendly competition. This gives replayability to the game and gives you something to work towards after beating the game.
